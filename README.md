# Ontology-of-CSS-Datasets
This repository holds the ontology for the thesis "An Ontology of CSS Datasets". The ontology was developed using the Protégé software and is stored in Web Ontology Language (OWL) file format. This repository holds two types of Ontology with holding same characteristics and values of CSS datatsets, but ontology was developed from two different perspectives. There are two files for each type, one is the .owl file for ontology and the other file is the  Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies(VOWL). 

Ontology File Name: OCSSD_Type1, OCSSD_Type2

This Ontology was developed to analyse and comprehend the Computational Social SCience (CSS) datasets from a diverse range of social networking and online platforms like X(Twitter), Reddit etc along with their characteristics like data availability, accessibility etc. The outcome of this ontology will provide a structure and systematic method to researchers for assessing the datasets in many ways. This up-to-date ontology will act as a knowledge representation framework which can serve the research community. Some of these services are addressing the complex characteristics of CSS datasets, facilitating collaboration, enhancing transparency and supporting future CSS research endeavors etc.
